npm init -y
package json

npm install express

npm install nodemon (if not installed globally for instant server updates)

npm install dotenv

set up scripts in package.json for running server with nodemon

initialize express app
require dotenv.config

setup port # in .env file

Listen to port # app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  //do something here
}

in expressRouter.js

require express
const router = express.Router()

then you can setup different HTTP requests 

end of file module.exports = router

Go back to server file and require router const expressRoutes = require("./routes/expressRouter")

Implement router with app.use("/api/expressRouter", expressRoutes)
